              In 2015 UXPin was an established design tool serving over two
              thousand companies. We've just raised our Series A (led by True
              Ventures and Jeff Veen â€“ former VP of Design at Adobe). We weren't
              happy, though. We knew that we have to do even more to realize our
              mission and help the design tools industry move forward. We
              started a design process that changed the entire industry.

            <p>
              In 2015 design tools were cluttered, slow, and obtrusive. As
              absurdly, as it sounds, nobody on the design tools market was
              focused on improving the state of design software. Somebody had to
              change it. UXPin was well-positioned to make that change.
              After all, UXPin was started by designers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many things were wrong with the design tools of that era.
              According to our research, the most critical factors affecting the
              experience of users were: color-heavy interfaces, lots of
              redundant panels, lack of concern for the overall usability of the
              system, poor performance. All the leading design tools companies
              seemed satisfied with this state of affairs. We didn't want to
              comply.
            </p>
            <p>
              At UXPin, we've decided to reject the status quo. We wanted to
              take the risk and do everything in our power to realize our
              mission. UXPin was started to connect design and engineering and
              helping the design industry progress. We could not achieve this
              mission without taking our design to the next level. In early 2015
              we were ready to act.

              The process of working on an entirely new approach to a design
              editor started with a memo sent to our entire team. I argued that
              we shouldn't be compliant with the industry, and instead, we
              should focus on user feedback and our ambition to create the best
              tool possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I called out the industry to be uninspired and misguided. I shared
              with the team a set of principles that we were to use to guide our
              work and a video of a concept prototype that I created to inspire
              a new approach to design tooling.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, I invited the entire team and, especially all
              designers, to participate in the process of creating the new
              UXPin.

              Web products of Grupa Nokaut had been dominant (2.5 million unique

              success on the mobile market. Our mobile offering, at the time,
              was limited to a dated mobile version of the core service built
              for old cell phones. This service was highly popular couple of

              For two subsequent weekends in January 2018, I designed and coded

            <p>
              I've spent way over a decade designing all sorts of products, but
              hardly ever â€“ brand identities. Nevertheless, I have a deep
              affection for the very special connection between art and
              storytelling always present in great brand design.

              When I decided to build my personal website, I knew that this is a
              great opportunity to define my brand â€“ my story, aesthetics and
              message with a holistic design process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I quickly became my own most demanding client and yet... I
              thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing Treder Design brand.
